Recipe Search App:

    Create a recipe search application where users can find recipes based on ingredients they have.
    
    Main Page:
    Input field for users to enter ingredients separated by commas.
    Search button to trigger the search for recipes.
    Display area to show search results.

    Functionality:
    When the user clicks the search button, fetch recipes from a recipe API (e.g., Spoonacular) based on the entered ingredients.
    Display recipe cards with titles, images, and a brief description.
    Clicking on a recipe card should expand it to show more details such as ingredients and instructions.
    Include a "Back" button to return to the main page.

    React Components:
    App: Main component to manage state and API requests.
    SearchForm: Component for the input field and search button.
    RecipeList: Component to display the list of recipe cards.
    RecipeCard: Component to render individual recipe cards.
    
    State Management:
    Use React state to manage the list of recipes and display them dynamically.
    Store the search input in the component's state.
    This application will help you practice basic React concepts like state management, component structure, and API integration in a simple and concise manner.
